## Core Philosophy

- **Accessibility First**: Making DeFi automation available to non-programmers
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on practical benefits rather than technical complexity
- **Guided Experience**: Step-by-step flows and clear instructions
- **Safety & Security**: Built-in protections and validations
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Seamless automation across multiple blockchains

## Key Features

### 1. Ready-Made Automations

Pre-built DeFi automation tools requiring zero coding knowledge.

#### Stop Order Automation

Our flagship automation that protects token investments across multiple chains:

- **Supported Networks**: Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia testnet, Avalanche C-Chain
- **Compatible DEXes**: Uniswap V2 (Ethereum), Pangolin (Avalanche)
- **Key Functionality**: Automatically sells tokens when prices drop below user-defined thresholds
- **Benefits**: 24/7 price monitoring without manual intervention

**User Flow**:
1. Select blockchain network and token pair
2. Configure stop price threshold using coefficient and threshold values
3. Specify token to sell and amount
4. Deploy with one-click operation
5. Receive purchased tokens and unused funds automatically when triggered
