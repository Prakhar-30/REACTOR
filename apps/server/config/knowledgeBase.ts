  faq: {
    "what is reactive smart contract": {
      answer: "Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs) are event-driven contracts that automatically monitor blockchain events and trigger actions without manual intervention. Unlike traditional smart contracts that require users to call functions, RSCs use an Inversion of Control paradigm to autonomously react to on-chain events.",
      relatedTopics: ["reactive network", "automation", "event-driven"]
    },
    
    "how do stop orders work": {
      answer: "Stop orders monitor token pair prices 24/7 and automatically sell your tokens when the price drops below your specified threshold. They deploy two contracts: a destination contract on your chosen chain and an RSC on Reactive Network kopli(for testnet) & React Mainnet(for mainnet) that monitors prices and triggers the sale.",
      relatedTopics: ["price protection", "automation", "cross-chain"]
    },

    "what is reactive network": {
      answer: "Reactive Network is the world's first event-driven blockchain designed specifically for autonomous smart contracts. It enables RSCs to monitor events across multiple chains and execute cross-chain actions automatically. Learn more at dev.reactive.network",
      relatedTopics: ["rsc", "cross-chain", "automation"]
    },

    "gas costs and fees": {
      answer: "Costs vary by automation type: Stop Orders need ~0.03-0.05 ETH for deployment plus 0.05 REACT tokens for RSC operation. Fee Collectors and Range Managers primarily use gas for transactions. All automations are optimized for gas efficiency.",
